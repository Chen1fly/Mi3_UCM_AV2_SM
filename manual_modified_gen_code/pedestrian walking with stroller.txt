# Get all pedestrian objects from the logs.
# These are potential candidates for pedestrians walking with strollers.
pedestrians = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='PEDESTRIAN')

# Get all stroller objects from the logs.
# These are the strollers that pedestrians might be walking with.
strollers = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='STROLLER')

# Filter pedestrians to include only those that are "walking".
# "Walking" implies movement. We use has_velocity with a minimum threshold
# slightly above the documented jitter level (0.5 m/s) to ensure actual motion.
# A pedestrian's walking speed is typically > 1 m/s, but they can also walk slowly.
# min_velocity=0.6 m/s is chosen to confidently identify moving pedestrians beyond sensor/annotation jitter.
walking_pedestrians = has_velocity(pedestrians, log_dir, min_velocity=0.6)

# If a pedestrian is "walking with" a stroller, the stroller is also expected to be moving.
# Filter strollers to include only those that are moving, using the same velocity threshold.
# This ensures we are looking for an active pairing of a walking pedestrian and a moving stroller.
moving_strollers = has_velocity(strollers, log_dir, min_velocity=0.6)

# Identify instances where a "walking pedestrian" is "with" a "moving stroller".
# "With" is interpreted as being in very close proximity, suggesting an association.
# We use near_objects to find walking_pedestrians that are near at least one moving_stroller.
# - track_candidates: walking_pedestrians. The primary objects we are interested in identifying.
# - related_candidates: moving_strollers. The objects the track_candidates must be near.
# - distance_thresh=1.0: A tight distance threshold (1 meter from center of pedestrian to center of stroller).
#   This is chosen for precision. For example:
#     - If a pedestrian (approx 0.5m deep) is pushing a stroller (approx 1m long),
#       the distance between their centers might be around 0.75m.
#     - If a pedestrian is walking directly beside a stroller (approx 0.6m wide),
#       the distance between their centers might be around 0.55m.
#   A 1.0m threshold captures these direct interactions while minimizing accidental inclusions
#   of nearby, unrelated pedestrians and strollers.
# - min_objects=1: The pedestrian must be near at least one moving stroller to satisfy the "with stroller" condition.

# Output the scenario. The resulting `pedestrian_walking_with_stroller` dictionary
