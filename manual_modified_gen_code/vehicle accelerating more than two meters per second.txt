# Description: vehicle accelerating more than two meters per second

# Get all objects of category 'VEHICLE'
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Identify vehicles that are accelerating with a forward acceleration greater than 2 m/s^2.
# The accelerating function's default min_accel is 0.65, and values over 1.0 reliably indicate acceleration.
# We set min_accel to 2.0 to match the description "more than two meters per second".
# It's assumed "meters per second" in the description refers to the unit of acceleration (m/s^2).
accelerating_vehicles = accelerating(vehicles, log_dir, min_accel=2.0)

# Output the scenario
output_scenario(accelerating_vehicles, description, log_dir, output_dir)
