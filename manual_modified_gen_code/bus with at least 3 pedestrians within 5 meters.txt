# Find buses that have at least 3 pedestrians within a 5-meter radius.
# The `near_objects` function is used here:
# - The first argument (`track_uuid`) takes the primary objects of interest (buses).
# - The second argument (`candidate_uuids`) takes the related objects to check for proximity (pedestrians).
# - `distance_thresh=5` specifies the maximum distance (5 meters) for pedestrians to be considered "near".
# - `min_objects=3` specifies that at least 3 pedestrians must be near the bus.
# The function is expected to return a scenario dictionary where keys are UUIDs of buses
# meeting the criteria, and values are timestamps of when the condition is met.

    min_objects=3       # Minimum number of pedestrians

# Output the resulting scenario
# This function will save the identified instances (buses with at least 3 pedestrians nearby)
# to a file in an evaluation-ready format.
