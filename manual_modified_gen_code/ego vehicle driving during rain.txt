description = 'ego vehicle driving during rain'

# Get the EGO_VEHICLE. The EGO_VEHICLE category refers to the vehicle collecting the data.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Determine if the ego vehicle is "driving".
# We can infer "driving" as the ego vehicle not being stationary (i.e., not parked).
# The stationary() function identifies objects that moved less than 2m over their observation period,
# which is suitable for distinguishing parked/inactive vehicles from active ones.
# scenario_not(stationary) will thus give us active ego vehicles.
driving_ego_vehicle = scenario_not(stationary)(ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# Add a crucial note about the "rain" condition:
# The provided set of functions does not include any capability to detect weather conditions like rain.
# Therefore, this script will identify instances where the ego vehicle is driving,
# but it cannot verify if it is raining during those instances.
# The results will encompass all scenarios of the ego vehicle driving, irrespective of the weather.

# Output the scenario.
# This will output timestamps where the ego vehicle is considered to be driving.
# The "during rain" part of the description cannot be programmatically verified with the given functions.
