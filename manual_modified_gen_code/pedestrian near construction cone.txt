# The 'near_objects' function is used for this.
# - 'track_uuid' (conceptually track_candidates) will be the pedestrians, as we are interested in finding instances of pedestrians.
# - 'candidate_uuids' (conceptually related_candidates) will be the construction cones, which pedestrians should be near.
# - 'distance_thresh' is set to 3.0 meters. This value is chosen to be relatively small
#   to ensure precision and reduce false positives, aligning with the request to "be precise".
#   A pedestrian within 3 meters of a cone can be reasonably considered "near".
# - 'min_objects' is set to 1, meaning the pedestrian must be near at least one construction cone.
