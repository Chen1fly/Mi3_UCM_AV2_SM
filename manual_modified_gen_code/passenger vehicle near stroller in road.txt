# Get all regular vehicles, which are considered passenger vehicles based on the category definition:
# "REGULAR_VEHICLE": Any conventionally sized passenger vehicle used for the transportation of people and cargo.
# This includes Cars, vans, pickup trucks, SUVs, etc.
passenger_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='REGULAR_VEHICLE')

# Get all stroller objects from the dataset.
# "STROLLER": Push-cart with wheels meant to hold a baby or toddler.
strollers = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='STROLLER')

# Filter the stroller objects to include only those that are on a road.
# The 'on_road' function is preferred over 'in_drivable_area' for precision,
# as it excludes areas like parking lots.
strollers_on_road = on_road(strollers, log_dir)

# Identify passenger vehicles that are near the strollers located on the road.
# The 'near_objects' function is used for this.
# - 'track_uuid' (passenger_vehicles): These are the primary objects we are interested in finding.
# - 'candidate_uuids' (strollers_on_road): These are the related objects that the primary objects must be near.
# - 'distance_thresh=5.0': Defines "near" as being within 5 meters. This value is chosen for a reasonable proximity
#   without being too restrictive or too broad, aiming for precision.
# - 'min_objects=1': Requires the passenger vehicle to be near at least one stroller on the road,
#   matching the singular "stroller" in the description.
