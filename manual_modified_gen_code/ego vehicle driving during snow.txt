description = 'ego vehicle driving during snow'

# Get the EGO_VEHICLE object
# The EGO_VEHICLE category refers to the data collection vehicle itself.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Filter for instances where the ego vehicle is "driving".
# "Driving" implies that the ego vehicle is not stationary.
# The has_velocity function can be used for this. Stationary objects might have a velocity up to 0.5 m/s due to jitter.
# So, a minimum velocity slightly above 0.5 m/s will indicate active driving.
ego_vehicle_driving = has_velocity(ego_vehicle, log_dir, min_velocity=0.51)

# The "during snow" part of the description cannot be directly addressed with the provided functions.
# There are no functions to detect weather conditions (like snow), ground conditions (snow cover),
# or atmospheric particles (falling snow).
# Therefore, the following scenario will identify instances of the "ego vehicle driving"
# but cannot verify if these instances occur "during snow".
# The output will include all timestamps where the ego vehicle is driving, regardless of weather.
# If such weather-related functions or data were available (e.g., a sensor indicating snow,
# or snow being a detectable object category), they would be used here with scenario_and.

# The scenario representing "ego vehicle driving" is ego_vehicle_driving.
# We acknowledge the limitation regarding "during snow".
