# Further filter the 'dogs_on_road' to find those that are "running".
# "Running" is interpreted as having a significant forward velocity.
# Stationary objects can have velocity up to 0.5 m/s due to jitter.
# A typical dog walking speed is around 1.3-1.8 m/s.
# We set a minimum velocity of 2.0 m/s to distinguish running from walking,
# aiming to capture dogs moving at a pace faster than a brisk walk.
# This helps to avoid false positives of dogs merely walking or standing on the road.

# This will include dog UUIDs and timestamps where a dog is on the road and has a velocity >= 2.0 m/s.
