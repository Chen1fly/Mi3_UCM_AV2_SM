# We define a "group" as consisting of at least 3 bicyclists.

# 5. Combine the two conditions using scenario_and.
# We are looking for vehicles that are BOTH turning AND near a group of bicyclists.
# scenario_and will return a dictionary of vehicles that are present in both `turning_vehicles`
# and `vehicles_near_group_of_bicyclists`, with their timestamps intersected for when both conditions are true.
vehicle_turning_near_group_of_cyclists = scenario_and([turning_vehicles, vehicles_near_group_of_bicyclists])

# 6. Output the resulting scenario.
