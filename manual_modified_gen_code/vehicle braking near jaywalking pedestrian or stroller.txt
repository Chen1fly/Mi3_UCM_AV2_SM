# Identify vehicles that are braking
# Braking is indicated by a negative acceleration. Values under -1.0 m/s^2 reliably indicate braking.

# Identify jaywalking pedestrians
# Jaywalking pedestrians are those on the road but not at a designated pedestrian crossing.
# First, find pedestrians that are on the road.

# Next, filter these to pedestrians not at a pedestrian crossing.
# at_pedestrian_crossing by default checks within 1 meter.
# scenario_not will give us pedestrians on road who are NOT within 1m of a pedestrian crossing.

# Similar to jaywalking pedestrians, these are strollers in a potentially unsafe road position.

# Identify braking vehicles that are near any of these hazardous road users (jaywalking pedestrians or strollers)
# near_objects checks if track_candidates (braking_vehicles) are near related_candidates (hazardous_road_users).
