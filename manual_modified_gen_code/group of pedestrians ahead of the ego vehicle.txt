# The EGO_VEHICLE is the vehicle collecting the data.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Get all PEDESTRIAN objects from the dataset
pedestrians = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='PEDESTRIAN')

# Find instances where the ego_vehicle has a group of pedestrians ahead of it.
# "group" is interpreted as at least 2 pedestrians.
# "ahead" is defined by the 'forward' direction.
# `within_distance` specifies the maximum longitudinal distance for pedestrians to be considered.
# `lateral_thresh` specifies the maximum lateral distance pedestrians can be from the sides of the ego vehicle.
# A lateral_thresh of 1.5m means pedestrians should be within a corridor roughly the width of the ego vehicle plus 3 meters (1.5m on each side).
# If the ego vehicle is ~2m wide, this results in a ~5m wide corridor, which should capture pedestrians directly ahead or in immediately adjacent paths.
