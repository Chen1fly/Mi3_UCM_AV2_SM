# The near_objects function identifies timestamps when a tracked object (vehicle) is near a specified set of related objects (message_board_trailers).
# Default distance_thresh is 10 meters, which is a reasonable interpretation of "near" in this context.
# Default min_objects is 1, which means at least one message board trailer must be near the vehicle.
