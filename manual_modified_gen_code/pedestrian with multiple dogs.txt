# The 'near_objects' function identifies track candidates (pedestrians) that have a minimum number
# of related candidates (dogs) within a specified distance.
# - track_uuid: The primary objects to analyze (pedestrians).
# - candidate_uuids: The related objects to look for (dogs).
# - distance_thresh: We define "with" or "near" as being within 5.0 meters. This is a reasonable
#   distance for a person to be accompanied by their dogs. A smaller value increases precision
#   but might miss valid cases; a larger value might include nearby but unrelated dogs.
# - min_objects: Set to 2 to match the "multiple dogs" requirement (i.e., two or more dogs).
