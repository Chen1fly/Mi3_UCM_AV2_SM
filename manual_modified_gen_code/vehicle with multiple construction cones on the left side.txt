# Identify vehicles that have multiple (at least 2) construction cones on their left side.
# We define "on the left side" with specific distance thresholds to be precise:
# - direction='left': We are looking for cones to the left of the vehicle.
# - min_number=2: We require at least two cones ("multiple").
# - within_distance=5.0: Cones must be within 5 meters to the left of the vehicle.
#   This helps ensure the cones are in an adjacent area/lane and not several lanes away.
# - lateral_thresh=2.0: Cones must be longitudinally within 2 meters of the vehicle's front or rear.
#   This means the cones are positioned alongside the vehicle, not far ahead or far behind its physical span.
#   The total longitudinal zone for cones is effectively vehicle_length + 2 * lateral_thresh.
