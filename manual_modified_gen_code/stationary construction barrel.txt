# description: stationary construction barrel
# First, get all objects categorized as 'CONSTRUCTION_BARREL'.
construction_barrels = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='CONSTRUCTION_BARREL')

# Then, filter these construction barrels to find those that are stationary.
# The stationary() function identifies objects that moved less than 2m over their observation length.
stationary_construction_barrels = stationary(construction_barrels, log_dir)

# Output the scenario.
