# Get all objects of the specific category 'TRUCK'.
# According to the provided category definitions, "TRUCK" is:
# TRUCK: Vehicles that are clearly defined as a truck but does not fit into any more specific subclass.
# Examples include common delivery vehicles (UPS, FedEx), mail trucks, garbage trucks, utility trucks, ambulances, dump trucks, etc.
# This category explicitly does not include "BOX_TRUCK" or "TRUCK_CAB".
# Using this specific category is the most direct interpretation of "truck" given it's a defined category name.
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')

# Filter these trucks to find those that are changing lanes to the right.
# The changing_lanes function identifies lane change events for the given track_candidates.
# We specify direction='right' to find only right lane changes.
trucks_changing_lanes_right = changing_lanes(trucks, log_dir, direction='right')

# Output the scenario.
# This function will save the identified instances for evaluation or visualization.
