# First, get all objects belonging to the 'VEHICLE' category.
# The 'VEHICLE' category is a superclass that includes REGULAR_VEHICLE, LARGE_VEHICLE, BUS, etc.

# Next, get all objects belonging to the 'CONSTRUCTION_BARREL' category.
construction_barrels = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category="CONSTRUCTION_BARREL")

# Now, find instances where a vehicle is near a construction barrel.
# We use the `near_objects` function for this.
# - track_uuid: We are interested in 'vehicles'.
# - candidate_uuids: We are checking for proximity to 'construction_barrels'.
# - log_dir: The path to the scenario logs.
# - distance_thresh: We set this to 5.0 meters. This means a vehicle is considered "near" a barrel
#   if the distance between them is 5 meters or less. This value is chosen to be precise
#   and reduce false positives, as construction barrels are relatively small and "near"
#   implies close proximity in a driving context. The default is 10m.
# - min_objects: We set this to 1, as the description refers to "a construction barrel" (singular).
#   This means we are looking for vehicles that have at least one construction barrel within the distance_thresh.
