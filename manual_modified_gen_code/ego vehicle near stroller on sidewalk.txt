# 1. Get the EGO_VEHICLE.
# The EGO_VEHICLE is the vehicle collecting the data. There should typically be only one.

# 2. Get all STROLLER objects from the dataset.

# 3. Identify strollers that are "on sidewalk".
# We define "on sidewalk" as not being on the road AND not being in a (vehicle) drivable area.
# This helps distinguish sidewalks from roads, parking lots, etc.

# Get strollers that are not on a road (road or bike lane).
strollers_not_on_road = scenario_not(on_road)(all_strollers, log_dir)

# Get strollers that are not in a drivable area.
strollers_not_in_drivable_area = scenario_not(in_drivable_area)(all_strollers, log_dir)

# Combine these conditions: a stroller is on the "sidewalk" if it's not on the road AND not in a drivable area.
# This should filter out strollers on roads, in parking lots (which are drivable), etc.
strollers_on_sidewalk = scenario_and([strollers_not_on_road, strollers_not_in_drivable_area])

# 4. Find instances where the ego vehicle is near such a stroller on the sidewalk.
# We use the near_objects function for this.
# - track_candidates: The ego_vehicle(s).
# - related_candidates: The strollers identified as being on a sidewalk.
# - distance_thresh: Defines "near". Let's set it to 5 meters.
# - min_objects: We are looking for at least one stroller.
ego_near_stroller_on_sidewalk = near_objects(
    track_candidates=ego_vehicles,
    related_candidates=strollers_on_sidewalk,

    distance_thresh=5,  # Maximum distance in meters to be considered "near"
    min_objects=1       # Must be near at least one stroller on the sidewalk
)

# 5. Output the resulting scenario.
# This will save the instances where the ego vehicle is near a stroller on a sidewalk.
