# Find instances where a box truck has multiple (at least 2) construction cones to its right.
# The function `has_objects_in_relative_direction` is used for this:
# - `track_candidates`: The box_trucks we identified.
# - `related_candidates`: The construction_cones we are looking for.
# - `log_dir`: Path to scenario logs.
# - `direction='right'`: Specifies that we are looking for cones on the right side of the box trucks.
# - `min_number=2`: "multiple" implies at least two cones.
# - `within_distance=5.0`: This parameter defines how far out (to the right, perpendicular to the truck's heading)
#   a cone can be from the truck's right side to be considered. 5.0 meters is a reasonable distance,
#   suggesting cones are in an adjacent lane or on the immediate shoulder.
# - `lateral_thresh=5.0`: This parameter constrains the position of the cones along the length of the truck (parallel to its heading).
#   It means a cone's center can be at most 5.0 meters ahead of the truck's front end or behind its rear end.
#   This ensures the cones are primarily alongside the truck, rather than far in front or far behind it.
#   This precision helps avoid false positives where cones might be generally to the right but not closely associated with the truck's immediate vicinity.
