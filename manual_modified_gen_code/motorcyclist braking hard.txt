# Description of the scenario
description = 'motorcyclist braking hard'

# Get all motorcycle objects from the logs.
# We are interested in the 'MOTORCYCLE' category, as physical attributes like acceleration
# are typically associated with the vehicle itself. The description "motorcyclist braking hard"
# refers to the action of the rider causing the motorcycle to brake.
# The 'MOTORCYCLE' category is defined as: "Motorized vehicle with two wheels where the rider
# straddles the engine. These are capable of high speeds similar to a car."
motorcycles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='MOTORCYCLE')

# Identify motorcycles that are braking hard.
# The 'accelerating' function can find objects with acceleration within a given range.
# For braking, the forward acceleration is negative.
# The function's documentation states: "Values under -1 reliably indicates braking."
# To be precise for "hard braking" and avoid false positives of gentle braking,
# we define "hard braking" as a forward acceleration less than or equal to -2.5 m/s^2
# (i.e., a deceleration of at least 2.5 m/s^2).

# Parameters for 'accelerating' function:
# - track_candidates: The motorcycle objects we identified.
# - log_dir: Path to scenario logs.
# - min_accel = -np.inf: This means there is no lower limit to how strong the deceleration can be
#   (e.g., -3.0 m/s^2, -4.0 m/s^2, etc., are all more negative than -2.5 m/s^2).
# - max_accel = -2.5: This sets the upper bound for the acceleration. An object's
#   acceleration 'a' must satisfy: min_accel <= a <= max_accel.
#   So, a <= -2.5 m/s^2. This ensures that only accelerations corresponding to
#   hard braking are included. For example, an acceleration of -1.5 m/s^2 (moderate braking)
#   would not be included, but -3.0 m/s^2 (hard braking) would.
hard_braking_motorcycles = accelerating(

# Output the resulting scenario.
# This will create a file containing the UUIDs of motorcycles that meet the "hard braking"
# criteria, along with the timestamps when this condition is met.
