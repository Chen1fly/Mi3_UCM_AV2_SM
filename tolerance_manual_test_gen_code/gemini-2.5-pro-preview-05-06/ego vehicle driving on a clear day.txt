# Description for the scenario
description = 'ego vehicle driving on a clear day'

# Get the EGO_VEHICLE object
# The EGO_VEHICLE category represents the vehicle collecting the data.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Identify instances where the ego vehicle is "driving".
# "Driving" implies that the vehicle is not stationary for a prolonged period.
# The `stationary` function identifies objects that moved less than 2m over their entire observation in the scenario.
# It's designed to distinguish parked/inactive vehicles from active ones.
# `scenario_not(stationary)` will thus return timestamps when the ego vehicle is considered active or moving.
driving_ego_vehicle = scenario_not(stationary)(ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# Regarding the "on a clear day" part of the description:
# The provided set of functions does not include any capabilities to determine
# weather conditions (e.g., "clear day", "rainy", "foggy") or lighting conditions (e.g., "day", "night").
# Therefore, this aspect of the scenario description cannot be programmatically identified
# using the available tools. The output will represent "ego vehicle driving"
# without the "clear day" condition.

# Output the scenario
# This will save the identified instances of the ego vehicle driving.
