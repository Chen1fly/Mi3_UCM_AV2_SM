# The user wants to find scenarios where a pedestrian is near a message board trailer.
# I will first get all the pedestrians and all the message board trailers in the scene.
# Then, I will use the near_objects function to find pedestrians that are near at least one message board trailer.
# Finally, I will output the resulting scenario.
