description= "cop car sitting on median"
# There is no specific category for "cop car", so we will look for regular vehicles that match the behavior.
# "sitting" implies the vehicle is stationary.
# "on median" implies the vehicle is not in a normal drivable lane. We can approximate this by finding vehicles that are not on the road.


# Get all regular vehicles, as police cars are often this type.
regular_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='REGULAR_VEHICLE')


# Find vehicles that are stationary.
stationary_vehicles = stationary(regular_vehicles, log_dir)


# A vehicle on a median would not be considered on the road.
# We can find vehicles that are not on the road by using scenario_not with the on_road function.
cop_car_on_median = scenario_not(on_road)(stationary_vehicles, log_dir)
