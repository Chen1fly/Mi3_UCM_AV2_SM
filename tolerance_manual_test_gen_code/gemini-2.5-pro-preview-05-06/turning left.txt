# Get all objects of the category 'VEHICLE'
# The 'turning' function is most relevant for vehicles, and the example provided uses 'VEHICLE'.
# Using 'VEHICLE' helps to be precise and avoid potential false positives from other object types
# whose 'turning' might not be as meaningful in a driving context.

# The 'turning' function filters the 'vehicles' dictionary to include only those

# Output the scenario
# This will save the identified instances of vehicles turning left.
# Visualization is turned off by default as per the instructions ("Do not provide any visualization kwargs").
