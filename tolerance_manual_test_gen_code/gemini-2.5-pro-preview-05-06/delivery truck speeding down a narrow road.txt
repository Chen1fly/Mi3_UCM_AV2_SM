# The user wants to find instances of a delivery truck speeding down a narrow road.
# I will break this down into three parts:
# 1. Identifying delivery trucks. The "TRUCK" and "BOX_TRUCK" categories seem most appropriate for this.
# 2. Identifying speeding vehicles. I will use the has_velocity function with a high min_velocity.
# 3. Identifying a narrow road. A narrow road can be inferred by the presence of other vehicles close to both sides of the subject vehicle.

# Get all truck and box_truck objects, as these are commonly used for deliveries.
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')
box_trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BOX_TRUCK')
delivery_trucks = scenario_or([trucks, box_trucks])

# Define "speeding" as traveling at a velocity greater than 15 m/s (approximately 33.5 mph).
# This is a reasonable speed to be considered speeding on many non-highway roads.
speeding_trucks = has_velocity(delivery_trucks, log_dir, min_velocity=15)

# Get all other vehicles that could be on the sides of the road.
other_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Find speeding trucks that have a vehicle to their left within a close lateral distance.
# A small lateral_thresh suggests a narrow lane or road.
trucks_with_vehicle_on_left = has_objects_in_relative_direction(
    speeding_trucks,
    other_vehicles,
    log_dir,
    direction='left',
    min_number=1,
    max_number=1,
    within_distance=20,
    lateral_thresh=1.5
)

# Find speeding trucks that have a vehicle to their right within a close lateral distance.
trucks_with_vehicle_on_right = has_objects_in_relative_direction(
    speeding_trucks,
    other_vehicles,
    log_dir,
    direction='right',
    min_number=1,
    max_number=1,
    within_distance=20,
    lateral_thresh=1.5
)

# A truck is considered to be on a narrow road if it has vehicles close on both its left and right sides.
speeding_on_narrow_road = scenario_and([trucks_with_vehicle_on_left, trucks_with_vehicle_on_right])
