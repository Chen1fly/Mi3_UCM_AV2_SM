# An unattended stroller is a stroller that does not have a person nearby.
# To find this, we first need to get all the strollers and all the pedestrians.

# We can assume that a pedestrian attending to a stroller will be very close to it.
# We will use a distance of 2 meters as the threshold for a pedestrian being near a stroller.
# We can use the `scenario_not` function in conjunction with `near_objects` to find strollers
# that do NOT have a pedestrian within 2 meters.
unattended_strollers = scenario_not(near_objects)(strollers, pedestrians, log_dir, distance_thresh=2)
# Finally, we output the scenario.
