# Description: moving bus being crossed by a bicycle

# Get all bus objects
buses = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BUS')

# Filter for buses that are moving
# stationary() identifies objects that moved less than 2m over their observation.
# scenario_not(stationary) will give us objects that are not stationary, i.e., moving.
moving_buses = scenario_not(stationary)(buses, log_dir)

# Get all bicycle objects
bicycles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BICYCLE')

# Identify moving buses that are being crossed by a bicycle.
# The being_crossed_by function identifies track_candidates (moving_buses)
# that are being crossed by related_candidates (bicycles).
# The default direction is "forward", meaning the bicycle crosses the forward path of the bus.
# Default forward_thresh=10 and lateral_thresh=5 will be used.
bus_crossed_by_bicycle = being_crossed_by(moving_buses, bicycles, log_dir)

# Output the scenario
