# The user wants to find instances of a car following the ego vehicle and getting closer.
# I can break this down into two main conditions:
# 1. A vehicle is following the ego vehicle.
# 2. That same vehicle is getting closer to the ego vehicle.

# First, I'll get all the vehicles and the ego vehicle from the dataset.
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# The `following` function can be used to identify vehicles that are following the ego vehicle.
# The function defines following as moving in the same direction and the same lane.
vehicles_following_ego = following(vehicles, ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# To determine if the following vehicle is "getting closer", I can use the `heading_toward` function.
# If a vehicle that is already following the ego vehicle is also heading towards it,
# it implies that the distance between them is decreasing.
car_following_and_getting_closer = heading_toward(vehicles_following_ego, ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# Finally, I will output the resulting scenario.
output_scenario(car_following_and_getting_closer, description, log_dir, output_dir)
