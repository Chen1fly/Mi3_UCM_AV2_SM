# Get all objects of category "REGULAR_VEHICLE".
# "REGULAR_VEHICLE" is defined as "Any conventionally sized passenger vehicle used for the transportation of people and cargo.
# This includes Cars, vans, pickup trucks, SUVs, etc.", which best represents "car" in the description.
cars = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category="REGULAR_VEHICLE")

# Identify instances where these cars are on a "BUS" lane.
# The function on_lane_type checks if the track candidates are on the specified lane type.
# The term "driving" is interpreted as the vehicle being operated or found within the bus lane,
# which includes being temporarily stopped in traffic. This aligns with similar examples
# that do not explicitly filter for continuous motion unless specified by verbs like "overtaking" or "accelerating".
cars_in_bus_lane = on_lane_type(cars, log_dir, lane_type="BUS")

# Output the scenario.
# This will create a file with all instances of cars found to be driving in a bus lane.
