# Scenario: stop sign on a road with two lanes per direction
#
# Intuition:
#   •  A four-lane, bidirectional road (two lanes each way) will have
#      traffic appearing on both lateral sides of the stop-sign **and**
#      vehicles travelling both with and against the sign’s facing
#      direction.
#   •  We therefore:
#        1. Keep only STOP_SIGN objects that lie on a drivable road
#           surface (not parking lots or sidewalks).
#        2. Require at least one vehicle within ±25 m that is located
#           to the *left* of the sign and at least one to the *right*.
#           (Two lateral neighbours ⇒ at least two side-by-side lanes.)
#        3. Require ≥ 2 vehicles ≤ 30 m straight *ahead* of the sign
#           (implying at least two lanes moving in that direction).
#        4. Require ≥ 1 vehicle ≤ 30 m *behind* the sign (verifying the
#           opposing flow of traffic).
#   •  A STOP_SIGN track that satisfies **all four** constraints is
#      very likely positioned on a road with two lanes per direction.
