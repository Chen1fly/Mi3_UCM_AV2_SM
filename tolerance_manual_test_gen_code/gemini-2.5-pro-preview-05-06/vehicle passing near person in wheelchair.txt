# Scenario: vehicle passing near person in wheelchair
# ---------------------------------------------------
# The goal is to flag moving vehicles that come very close (â‰¤ 5 m) to a person
# in a wheelchair who is on the roadway or bike lane.  This keeps the search
# specific enough to avoid distant, coincidental co-occurrences.

description = 'vehicle passing near person in wheelchair'

# 1) Collect relevant object sets
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')
wheelchairs = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='WHEELCHAIR')

# 2) Focus on active, moving vehicles only
moving_vehicles = scenario_not(stationary)(vehicles, log_dir)

# 3) Restrict wheelchairs to those actually on the road (or bike lane)
wheelchairs_on_road = on_road(wheelchairs, log_dir)

# 4) Identify moving vehicles that come within 5 m of at least one wheelchair
vehicles_passing_near_wheelchair = near_objects(
    moving_vehicles,          # track_candidates
    wheelchairs_on_road,      # related_candidates
