# The goal is to identify pedestrians who are moving quickly and crossing in front of moving vehicles.


# Get all pedestrians and vehicles from the logs.
pedestrians = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='PEDESTRIAN')
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')


# Filter for vehicles that are actively moving, representing "traffic".
# We exclude stationary vehicles to focus on dynamic traffic situations.
moving_vehicles = scenario_not(stationary)(vehicles, log_dir)


# Identify pedestrians that are moving at a high speed, which indicates a "darting" motion.
# A normal walking speed is around 1.4 m/s, so a threshold of 2.5 m/s captures running or darting.
darting_pedestrians = has_velocity(pedestrians, log_dir, min_velocity=2.5)


# Ensure the darting pedestrians are on the road surface.
darting_pedestrians_on_road = on_road(darting_pedestrians, log_dir)


# Find instances where these darting pedestrians cross in front of moving vehicles.
# 'being_crossed_by' identifies the vehicles being crossed. By reversing the relationship,
# we make the pedestrian who is performing the crossing the primary object of the scenario.
# We set a forward_thresh of 20m to capture pedestrians crossing a short distance ahead of the vehicle.
pedestrian_darting_through_traffic = reverse_relationship(being_crossed_by)(moving_vehicles, darting_pedestrians_on_road, log_dir, direction="forward", forward_thresh=20)
