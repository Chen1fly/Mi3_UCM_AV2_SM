# The user wants to find instances of a truck unloading in the middle of the road.
# This can be broken down into finding trucks that are stationary and on a road.
description = "truck unloading in the middle of the road"

# First, get all objects that are categorized as a "TRUCK".
# This will include BOX_TRUCK, TRUCK, etc. if we used "VEHICLE" but the user was specific.
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')

# Next, we want to find the trucks that are not moving.
# The stationary() function is a good way to identify parked or stopped vehicles.
stationary_trucks = stationary(trucks, log_dir)

# We also need to ensure the truck is on a road.
# The on_road() function can identify objects on a road surface.
trucks_on_road = on_road(trucks, log_dir)

# To find trucks that are both stationary and on the road, we can use scenario_and.
# This will give us the intersection of the two conditions, which represents
# a truck that is stopped in the middle of a road.
unloading_truck = scenario_and([stationary_trucks, trucks_on_road])

# Finally, output the resulting scenario.
