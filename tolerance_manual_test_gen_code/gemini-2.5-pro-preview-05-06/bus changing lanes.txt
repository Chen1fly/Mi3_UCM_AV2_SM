# Define the description for the scenario
description = 'bus changing lanes'

# Get all objects of the category 'BUS'
# The 'BUS' category includes standard city buses and school buses might be covered by 'SCHOOL_BUS' if separate.
# For a general "bus", 'BUS' is the most direct category. If school buses and articulated buses also count,
# one might need to use scenario_or with get_objects_of_category for 'BUS', 'SCHOOL_BUS', 'ARTICULATED_BUS'.
# However, given the description "bus", the 'BUS' category should be the primary target.
buses = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BUS')

# Identify buses that are changing lanes.
# The changing_lanes function with direction=None will detect lane changes to both left and right.
bus_lane_changes = changing_lanes(buses, log_dir)

# Output the scenario
# This will save the instances of buses changing lanes.
output_scenario(bus_lane_changes, description, log_dir, output_dir)
