# Description: vehicle accelerating aggressively
# This scenario aims to identify vehicles that are accelerating forward at a high rate.

# Get all objects of category 'VEHICLE'
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Identify vehicles that are accelerating aggressively.
# The 'accelerating' function's docstring suggests that values over 1.0 m/s^2 reliably indicate acceleration.
# For "aggressive" acceleration, we can set a higher threshold, for example, 2.0 m/s^2.
# This value might need tuning based on dataset characteristics and desired sensitivity.
aggressive_accelerating_vehicles = accelerating(vehicles, log_dir, min_accel=2.0)

# Output the scenario
output_scenario(aggressive_accelerating_vehicles, description, log_dir, output_dir)
