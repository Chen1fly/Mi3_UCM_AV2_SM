# Scenario: ego vehicle driving on streetcar tracks
# ------------------------------------------------
# The approach is to flag every time the ego-vehicle shares the *same*
# roadway lane with any object of category “RAILED_VEHICLE” (streetcars,
# trams, trolleys, etc.).  
# If the ego and a rail-bound vehicle occupy the same lane, the ego must
# be positioned directly on the embedded street-rail tracks, which is the
# behaviour we want to capture.

# 1. Ego vehicle track(s)

# 2. All rail-bound vehicles (trams, streetcars, etc.)

# 3. Moments when the ego vehicle occupies the *same road lane* as a rail vehicle
