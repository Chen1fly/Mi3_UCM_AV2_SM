# Identify vehicles that are braking heavily.
# The `accelerating` function can be used to find objects with a specific range of forward acceleration.
# For braking, the acceleration values will be negative.
# The docstring for `accelerating` states: "Values under -1 reliably indicates braking."
# To capture "heavily braking", we'll use a threshold more negative than -1.0 m/s^2.
# We define "heavily braking" as having a forward acceleration less than or equal to -2.0 m/s^2.
# So, min_accel is set to -np.inf (or a very small number) and max_accel is set to -2.0.
