# The user wants to find a person directing traffic in a school zone.
# The best way to identify a person directing traffic is to use the 'OFFICIAL_SIGNALER' category.
# A school zone can be inferred by the presence of a 'SCHOOL_BUS'.
# Therefore, the scenario can be defined as an 'OFFICIAL_SIGNALER' near a 'SCHOOL_BUS'.

# First, get all instances of official signalers.
person_directing_traffic = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='OFFICIAL_SIGNALER')

# Next, get all instances of school buses.

# An official signaler directing traffic will be on the road.
person_directing_traffic_on_road = on_road(person_directing_traffic, log_dir)

# Find the signalers that are near a school bus.
# A distance of 30 meters is a reasonable threshold to capture the context of a school zone around a bus.
