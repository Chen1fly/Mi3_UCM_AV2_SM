# Get all objects categorized as 'TRUCK'.
# The 'TRUCK' category includes vehicles like delivery trucks, mail trucks, garbage trucks, etc.,
# but excludes BOX_TRUCK and TRUCK_CAB which are separate categories.

# Identify trucks that are accelerating.
# The 'accelerating' function by default considers objects with a forward acceleration
# greater than 0.65 m/s^2 as accelerating. This threshold is generally reliable.
accelerating_trucks = accelerating(trucks, log_dir)

# Output the scenario.
# This will save the track UUIDs of accelerating trucks and the timestamps when they are accelerating.
