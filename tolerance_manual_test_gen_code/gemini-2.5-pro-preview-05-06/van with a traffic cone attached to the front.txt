# Scenario: van with a traffic cone attached to the front
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The goal is to find any regular-sized passenger vehicle (which includes vans) that
# has a construction cone extremely close to, and directly in front of, its bumper.
# A tight forward distance (≤ 1.5 m) and narrow lateral threshold (≤ 0.75 m)
# should minimize false positives and approximate a cone truly “attached” to the front.

description = 'van with a traffic cone attached to the front'

# 1. Gather candidate objects
regular_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='REGULAR_VEHICLE')  # includes vans
traffic_cones     = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='CONSTRUCTION_CONE')

# 2. Find vehicles with a cone directly ahead
vehicles_with_cone_front = has_objects_in_relative_direction(
    track_candidates=regular_vehicles,
    related_candidates=traffic_cones,
    log_dir=log_dir,
    direction='forward',
    min_number=1,         # at least one cone
    max_number=1,         # only need the closest cone
    within_distance=1.5,  # ≤ 1.5 m ahead of the bumper
    lateral_thresh=0.75   # ≤ 0.75 m from the vehicle’s centerline
)

# 3. Output the result
