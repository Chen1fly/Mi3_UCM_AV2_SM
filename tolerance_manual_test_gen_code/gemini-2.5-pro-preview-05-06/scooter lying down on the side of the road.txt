# The user is asking to find a scooter that is lying on the side of the road.
# A scooter can be categorized as a 'WHEELED_DEVICE'.
# A scooter that is lying down would be stationary.
# "Side of the road" can be interpreted as being on the road but not in a traffic lane, or more simply, just being stationary on the road.
# Since a moving object cannot be 'lying down', finding stationary scooters on a road is a good way to identify this scenario.

description = "scooter lying down on the side of the road"

# Get all wheeled devices, which include scooters.
wheeled_devices = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='WHEELED_DEVICE')

# Identify which of these wheeled devices are stationary.
# The stationary() function is suitable for objects that are not temporarily stopped but are stationary for a significant duration.
# This aligns with the idea of a scooter 'lying down' or being abandoned.
stationary_wheeled_devices = stationary(wheeled_devices, log_dir)

# Identify which of the stationary wheeled devices are on a road or bike lane.
# This places the stationary scooter in the context of the road environment.
stationary_scooters_on_road = on_road(stationary_wheeled_devices, log_dir)

# The final scenario is a wheeled device that is both stationary and on the road.
