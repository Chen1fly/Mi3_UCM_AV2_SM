# Find all instances of a person walking two dogs.
# The description implies a person who is actively moving with two dogs nearby.


# Get all pedestrians from the dataset.

# Filter for pedestrians that are actually moving, as "walking" implies motion.
# We use a minimum velocity of 0.5 m/s to filter out stationary or very slow-moving pedestrians.

# Find moving pedestrians who are near at least two dogs.
# We set a distance threshold of 5 meters to ensure the dogs are close to the person.
