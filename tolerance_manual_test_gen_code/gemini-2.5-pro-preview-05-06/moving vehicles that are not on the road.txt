# Filter for vehicles that are "moving".
# "moving" is interpreted as not stationary (i.e., not parked or inactive for their entire observation period).
# The 'stationary' function identifies objects that moved less than 2m over their length of observation.
# 'scenario_not(stationary)' will thus return vehicles that are generally active in the scenario.

# Filter for moving vehicles that are not on the road.
# The 'on_road' function identifies objects on a road or bike lane.
# Applying 'scenario_not(on_road)' to 'moving_vehicles' will select those vehicles
# from the 'moving_vehicles' set, but only at timestamps where they are not on a road.
# This means if a moving vehicle is sometimes on the road and sometimes off-road,
# only the off-road timestamps will be kept.
moving_vehicles_not_on_road = scenario_not(on_road)(moving_vehicles, log_dir)

# Output the scenario
# This will save the identified instances of moving vehicles that are not on the road.
