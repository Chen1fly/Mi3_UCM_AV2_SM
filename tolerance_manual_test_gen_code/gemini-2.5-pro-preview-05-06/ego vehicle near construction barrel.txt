# Scenario: ego vehicle near construction barrel
# -------------------------------------------------
# 1) Retrieve the ego-vehicle track(s).
# 2) Retrieve all construction barrel tracks.
# 3) Select the timestamps where the ego vehicle is within 5 m of at least one construction barrel.
# 4) Write the resulting scenario to disk so it can be evaluated.
