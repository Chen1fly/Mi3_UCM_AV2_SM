# The 'turning' function can be used to identify when a vehicle's turn signals are active.
# Hazard lights are indicated by both the left and right turn signals being active simultaneously.
# Therefore, we can find vehicles with flashing hazard lights by finding the intersection of vehicles
# that are turning left and vehicles that are turning right at the same timestamps.


description = 'vehicle flashing their hazard lights'


# First, get all objects categorized as 'VEHICLE'.
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')


# Identify all instances where vehicles have their left turn signal on.
left_signal_on = turning(vehicles, log_dir, direction='left')


# Identify all instances where vehicles have their right turn signal on.
right_signal_on = turning(vehicles, log_dir, direction='right')


# A vehicle has its hazard lights on if both its left and right signals are active at the same time.
# We can find these instances by taking the intersection of the two previous scenarios.
vehicle_with_hazard_lights = scenario_and([left_signal_on, right_signal_on])


# Output the resulting scenario.
