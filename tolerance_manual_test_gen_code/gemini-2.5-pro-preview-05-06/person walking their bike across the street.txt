# Find instances of a person walking their bike across the street.

# We can find these by looking for pedestrians that have a bicycle object near them.
# We will use a small distance threshold to be confident the pedestrian is with the bike.

# The "walking" part implies the person is moving. We can filter for pedestrians that are not stationary.
# We will consider any speed above 0.5 m/s as moving to account for slow walking speeds.

# We can be more specific and say they are not at a pedestrian crossing to find more dangerous situations.
