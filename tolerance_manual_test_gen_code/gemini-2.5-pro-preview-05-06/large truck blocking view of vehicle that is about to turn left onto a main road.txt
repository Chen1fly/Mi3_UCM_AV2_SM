# description: large truck blocking view of vehicle that is about to turn left onto a main road

# First, we identify all vehicles that are in the process of turning left.
# The scenario implies the vehicle is at an intersection or junction, preparing to enter a main road.
all_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')
vehicles_turning_left = turning(all_vehicles, log_dir, direction='left')

# We further refine this to vehicles that are near an intersection, as this is the most likely place for such a turn to occur.
# A 15-meter threshold is used to define "near" the intersection.
turning_vehicles_near_intersection = near_intersection(vehicles_turning_left, log_dir, threshold=15)

# Next, we identify potential obstructing vehicles. These are large trucks that can block a driver's view.
# We create a combined list of various large vehicle categories.
box_trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BOX_TRUCK')
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')
truck_cabs = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK_CAB')
large_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='LARGE_VEHICLE')
buses = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BUS')

# We combine all large vehicle types into a single scenario dictionary.
all_large_trucks = scenario_or([box_trucks, trucks, truck_cabs, large_vehicles, buses])

# To block the view of a vehicle turning left, the large truck must be positioned to the left of the turning vehicle.
# This would obscure the view of oncoming traffic from the left.
# We use `has_objects_in_relative_direction` to find turning vehicles that have a large truck to their left.
# - `within_distance=10`: The truck is within 10 meters to the left of the car, likely in an adjacent lane.
# - `lateral_thresh=20`: The truck can be up to 20 meters forward or backward from the car's position, creating a large blind spot.
