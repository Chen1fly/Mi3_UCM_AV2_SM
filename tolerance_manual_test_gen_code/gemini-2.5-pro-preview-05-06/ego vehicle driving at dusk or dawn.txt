# Get the EGO_VEHICLE. The EGO_VEHICLE is the vehicle collecting the data.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Determine if the ego vehicle is "driving".
# We interpret "driving" as the ego vehicle being active (not parked).
# The `stationary` function is intended to separate parked from active vehicles.
# `scenario_not(stationary)` will return the ego_vehicle with timestamps where it is considered active.
# According to the documentation for `stationary`:
# "Returns objects that moved less than 2m over their length of observation in the scneario.
# This object is only intended to separate parked from active vehicles.
# Use has_velocity() with thresholding if you want to indicate vehicles that are temporarily stopped."
# Thus, `scenario_not(stationary)` should give us vehicles that are part of traffic,
# potentially including those temporarily stopped (e.g., at a light), which aligns with "driving".
driving_ego_vehicle = scenario_not(stationary)(ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# The part "at dusk or dawn" cannot be determined with the provided functions,
# as there are no functions to ascertain the time of day, lighting conditions,
# or related indicators (e.g., headlights status).
# The scenario will therefore identify instances of "ego vehicle driving"
# without filtering for dusk/dawn conditions.
