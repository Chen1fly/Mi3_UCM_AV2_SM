# First, get all objects of the category 'VEHICLE'.

# Then, identify which of these vehicles are at a stop sign.
# The at_stop_sign function identifies objects in a lane corresponding to a stop sign
# and within a certain forward distance of it.
# The default forward_thresh is 10m, which is suitable for this description.
vehicles_at_stop_sign_scenario = at_stop_sign(vehicles, log_dir)
