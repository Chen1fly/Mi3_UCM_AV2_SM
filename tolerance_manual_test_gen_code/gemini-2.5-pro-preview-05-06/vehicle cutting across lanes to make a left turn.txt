# Defines a scenario for a vehicle that is cutting across one or more lanes to make a left turn.
description = "vehicle cutting across lanes to make a left turn"

# Get all vehicles in the scene.
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Identify all vehicles that are in the process of turning left.
left_turning_vehicles = turning(vehicles, log_dir, direction='left')

# Identify all vehicles that are in the process of changing lanes.
# We don't specify a direction for the lane change to be general,
# as a vehicle might make multiple lane changes before the turn.
lane_changing_vehicles = changing_lanes(vehicles, log_dir)

# The target scenario is a vehicle that is both changing lanes and turning left.
# We can find this by taking the intersection of the two scenarios defined above.
