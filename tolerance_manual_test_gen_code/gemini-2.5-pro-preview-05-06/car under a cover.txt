# The provided functions do not have a way to determine if a vehicle is under a cover, as this is a visual attribute
# not directly captured by the object's category, position, or movement.
# However, a car under a cover is almost certainly stationary.
# Therefore, this script will identify all stationary vehicles as a proxy for this scenario.
# This will find all parked cars, which could then be manually reviewed to find instances of covered cars.

description = 'car under a cover'

# First, get all objects that belong to the 'VEHICLE' superclass.
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Next, filter this set of vehicles to only include those that are stationary.
# A covered car would be parked and therefore stationary.
stationary_vehicles = stationary(vehicles, log_dir)

# Output the resulting scenario. This will contain all stationary vehicles,
# which is the closest approximation to "car under a cover" possible with the given functions.
