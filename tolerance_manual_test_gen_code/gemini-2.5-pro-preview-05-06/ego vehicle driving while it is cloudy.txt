# Get the ego vehicle. The EGO_VEHICLE category refers to the vehicle collecting the data.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Identify instances where the ego vehicle is driving.
# "Driving" is interpreted as the ego vehicle having a velocity greater than a threshold
# that distinguishes it from being stationary or having minor jitter.
# According to has_velocity documentation, stationary objects can have velocity up to 0.5 m/s.
# We'll use 1.0 m/s as a minimum threshold for "driving".

# The "while it is cloudy" part of the description cannot be determined using the provided functions.
# The available functions relate to object detection, kinematics, and road topology,
# but do not include any information about weather conditions like cloudiness.
# Therefore, this scenario will identify all instances of the ego vehicle driving,
# irrespective of the weather conditions.
