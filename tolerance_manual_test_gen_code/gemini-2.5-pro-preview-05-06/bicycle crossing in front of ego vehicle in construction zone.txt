# The user wants to find instances of a bicycle crossing in front of the ego vehicle in a construction zone.
# To do this, we first need to identify all the objects that define a construction zone.
# These include cones, barrels, and specific signs.

barrels = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='CONSTRUCTION_BARREL')

# We can combine all these construction-related objects into a single scenario dictionary.
construction_objects = scenario_or([cones, barrels, mobile_signs, message_boards, official_signalers])

# Next, we get the ego vehicle and all bicycles.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')
bicycles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BICYCLE')

# We need to find when the ego vehicle is near any of these construction objects.
# A distance of 50 meters is used to define the area of the construction zone around the ego vehicle.

# Now, we can find bicycles that are crossing in front of the ego vehicle, but only during the times
# the ego vehicle is in the construction zone.
# 'being_crossed_by' identifies when the second argument (bicycles) crosses the path of the first (ego_vehicle).
# 'reverse_relationship' is used to make the bicycle the primary object of the scenario.
# We are looking for crossings within 20 meters in front of the ego vehicle.
bicycle_crossing_in_front_of_ego_in_construction = reverse_relationship(being_crossed_by)(ego_in_construction_zone, bicycles, log_dir, direction='forward', forward_thresh=20)
