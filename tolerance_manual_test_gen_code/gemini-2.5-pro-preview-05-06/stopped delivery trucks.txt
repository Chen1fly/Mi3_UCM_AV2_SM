# Find instances of stopped delivery trucks.
#
# This script identifies vehicles that are likely delivery trucks (Box Trucks or regular Trucks)
# and are currently stopped on a road.
#

# First, we get all objects that could be considered delivery trucks.
# The 'TRUCK' and 'BOX_TRUCK' categories are the most suitable for this.
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')
box_trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BOX_TRUCK')

# We combine these two categories into a single scenario dictionary of potential delivery trucks.
delivery_trucks = scenario_or([trucks, box_trucks])

# Next, we identify the trucks from the list that are stationary.
# For a delivery, a truck is temporarily stopped. According to the function documentation,
# `has_velocity` with a low maximum threshold is the correct function to use for this,
# as `stationary()` is for permanently parked vehicles. We use a threshold of 0.5 m/s
# to account for potential sensor and annotation jitter.
stopped_trucks = has_velocity(delivery_trucks, log_dir, max_velocity=0.5)

# A delivery truck is typically stopped on a road. We filter for trucks that are on a road surface.
on_road_trucks = on_road(stopped_trucks, log_dir)

# The final scenario consists of objects that meet all the above criteria:
# they are a type of delivery truck, they are stopped, and they are on a road.
# `on_road_trucks` already represents this combination of filters.
