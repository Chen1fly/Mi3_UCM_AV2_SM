# We are interested in cones that are on the road, as they are likely to be blocking traffic.

# Road entrances are typically at or near intersections.
# We will filter for cones that are within 15 meters of an intersection.
cones_near_intersection = near_intersection(cones_on_road, log_dir, threshold=15)

# "Blocking" implies that there is a group or line of cones.
# We will use near_objects to find cones that are part of a cluster.
# We define a cluster as a cone having at least two other cones within 3 meters.
# This ensures we find groups of at least 3 cones, which is a strong indication of a blockade.
