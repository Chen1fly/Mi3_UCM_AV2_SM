# Scenario: vehicle near multiple bollards
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Retrieve all vehicles and bollards from the log.
# 2. Identify vehicles that are within 5 m of at least two distinct bollards.
#    • A tighter distance threshold (5 m vs. the 10 m default) helps reduce false positives.
#    • Setting min_objects = 2 ensures “multiple” bollards means more than one.
# 3. Write the resulting scenario to disk.
