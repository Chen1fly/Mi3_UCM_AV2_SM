# The user wants to find instances where the ego vehicle is traveling on a cobblestone street.
# There are no functions available to determine the surface material of the road (e.g., cobblestone, asphalt, dirt).
# The closest available function is on_road(), which can determine if a vehicle is on a road.
# This will be a significant false positive, but it is the closest possible solution with the given functions.

description = 'ego vehicle traveling on cobblestone street'

# Get the ego vehicle.
ego_vehicle = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Check when the ego vehicle is on a road. This is used as a proxy for being on a cobblestone street
# as there is no more specific function available.
ego_on_cobblestone = on_road(ego_vehicle, log_dir)

# Output the resulting scenario.
