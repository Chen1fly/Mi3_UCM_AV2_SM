# Define the description of the scenario
description = "pedestrians walking around a vehicle parked on a crosswalk"

# Get all vehicles and pedestrians from the dataset
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')
pedestrians = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='PEDESTRIAN')

# Identify vehicles that are parked (stationary)
parked_vehicles = stationary(vehicles, log_dir)

# Identify parked vehicles that are on a pedestrian crossing
# A distance of 0 ensures the vehicle's bounding box intersects with the crosswalk area.
vehicles_on_crosswalk = at_pedestrian_crossing(parked_vehicles, log_dir, within_distance=0)

# Identify pedestrians that are not stationary (i.e., walking)
walking_pedestrians = scenario_not(stationary)(pedestrians, log_dir)

# Find walking pedestrians that are near the vehicles parked on the crosswalk.
# A distance_thresh of 5 meters is used to capture pedestrians in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle.
pedestrians_around_vehicle = near_objects(walking_pedestrians, vehicles_on_crosswalk, log_dir, distance_thresh=5, min_objects=1)

# Output the final scenario
