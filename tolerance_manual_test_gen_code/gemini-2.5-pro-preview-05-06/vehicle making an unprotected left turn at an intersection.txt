# The user wants to find instances of a vehicle making an unprotected left turn at an intersection.
# An unprotected left turn is one where the turning vehicle must yield to oncoming traffic.
# Therefore, the core of this scenario is a vehicle turning left at an intersection
# while another vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction at the same intersection.

description = "vehicle making an unprotected left turn at an intersection"

# First, get all vehicle objects in the dataset.
vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Identify all vehicles that are in the process of turning left.
left_turning_vehicles = turning(vehicles, log_dir, direction='left')

# Identify all vehicles that are located within the boundaries of an intersection.
vehicles_at_intersection = on_intersection(vehicles, log_dir)

# To find vehicles making a left turn at an intersection, we find the intersection of the two previous scenarios.
# This gives us the primary actor for our scenario.
left_turn_at_intersection = scenario_and([left_turning_vehicles, vehicles_at_intersection])

# The "unprotected" nature of the turn is defined by the presence of oncoming traffic that has the right-of-way.
# We first identify all vehicles that are heading in the opposite direction relative to our turning vehicles.
oncoming_traffic = heading_in_relative_direction_to(vehicles, left_turn_at_intersection, log_dir, direction='opposite')

# This oncoming traffic is only relevant if it is also at the same intersection.
oncoming_traffic_at_intersection = scenario_and([oncoming_traffic, vehicles_at_intersection])

# Finally, we identify the vehicles turning left at an intersection that have at least one oncoming vehicle
# in front of them at that same intersection. This signifies an unprotected turn scenario.
# We use a 50-meter distance threshold to consider the oncoming vehicle as a relevant factor.
unprotected_left_turn = has_objects_in_relative_direction(
    track_candidates=left_turn_at_intersection,
