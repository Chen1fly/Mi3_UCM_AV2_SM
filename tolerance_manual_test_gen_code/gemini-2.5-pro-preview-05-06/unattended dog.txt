# Scenario: "unattended dog"

description = 'unattended dog'

# 1) Retrieve every annotated dog in the log
dogs = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='DOG')

# 2) Keep only the dogs that are actually on the roadway; this focuses the search
#    on dogs that could interfere with traffic and avoids pets on distant sidewalks/yards.
dogs_on_road = on_road(dogs, log_dir)

# 3) Retrieve every pedestrian (potential attendant)
pedestrians = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='PEDESTRIAN')

# 4) Remove any dog that has a pedestrian within 7 m.
#    - near_objects() marks dogs that ARE near a pedestrian,
#    - scenario_not(near_objects) gives the complementary set: dogs with no pedestrian near.
