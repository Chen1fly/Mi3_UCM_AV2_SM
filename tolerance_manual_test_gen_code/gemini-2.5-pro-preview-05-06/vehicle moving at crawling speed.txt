# Filter vehicles that are moving at a crawling speed.
# "Crawling speed" is defined as a speed greater than what might be considered stationary due to sensor jitter (0.5 m/s)
# and less than a slow walking/shuffling speed (e.g., 1.5 m/s).
# - min_velocity=0.5: According to has_velocity documentation, stationary objects may have velocity up to 0.5 m/s due to jitter.
#                       Setting min_velocity slightly above this ensures we capture actual movement.
# - max_velocity=1.5: This is an estimation for "crawling speed". 1.5 m/s is approximately 5.4 km/h or 3.35 mph.
#                       This range should capture vehicles that are moving very slowly but are not stopped.
