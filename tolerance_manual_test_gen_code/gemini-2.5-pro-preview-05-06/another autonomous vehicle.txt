# The user is asking to find 'another autonomous vehicle'.
# In the provided dataset categories, there is an 'EGO_VEHICLE' which is the autonomous vehicle collecting the data.
# There isn't a specific category for other autonomous vehicles.
# Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation of this query is to find all vehicles in the scene that are not the ego vehicle itself.
# This code identifies all objects belonging to the 'VEHICLE' superclass and then excludes the 'EGO_VEHICLE' from this set.

description = "another autonomous vehicle"

# Get all objects categorized as a vehicle. This includes regular cars, trucks, buses, etc.
all_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# Filter out the ego vehicle from the set of all vehicles to find all "other" vehicles.
# The `scenario_not` function wraps the `is_category` function.
# `is_category` will identify any vehicle from the `all_vehicles` dictionary that is an 'EGO_VEHICLE'.
# `scenario_not` will then return all vehicles from `all_vehicles` that were NOT identified as the 'EGO_VEHICLE'.
another_autonomous_vehicle = scenario_not(is_category)(all_vehicles, log_dir, category='EGO_VEHICLE')

# Output the resulting scenario, which contains all vehicles that are not the ego vehicle.
output_scenario(another_autonomous_vehicle, description, log_dir, output_dir)
