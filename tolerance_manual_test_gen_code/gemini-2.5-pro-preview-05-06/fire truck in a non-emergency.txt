# Scenario: fire truck in a non-emergency
description = 'fire truck in a non-emergency'

# 1. Retrieve every object that could be annotated as a fire truck.
#    In the ontology, fire trucks fall under the LARGE_VEHICLE category.
large_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='LARGE_VEHICLE')

# 2. Heuristically define “non-emergency” behaviour.
#    We treat a fire truck as non-emergency when it is either:
#       • stopped / parked (stationary), OR
#       • creeping along very slowly (≤ 5 m/s),
#    regardless of whether its lights are on (lights are not encoded in the dataset).
#
#    2a) Fire trucks that remain essentially parked for the duration observed.
stationary_large_vehicles = stationary(large_vehicles, log_dir)

#    2b) Fire trucks that roll forward only at walking speed.
slow_large_vehicles = has_velocity(large_vehicles, log_dir, min_velocity=0.5, max_velocity=5)

#    Combine (union) stationary and slow-moving tracks to capture both cases.
non_emergency_motion = scenario_or([stationary_large_vehicles, slow_large_vehicles])

# 3. Restrict the result to vehicles that are physically on the road
#    (and not in parking lots or other drivable areas).
large_vehicles_on_road = on_road(large_vehicles, log_dir)

# 4. A fire truck is considered “non-emergency” only if it satisfies BOTH
#    the motion condition from step 2 and the spatial constraint from step 3.
fire_truck_non_emergency = scenario_and([non_emergency_motion, large_vehicles_on_road])

# 5. Save the resulting scenario.
