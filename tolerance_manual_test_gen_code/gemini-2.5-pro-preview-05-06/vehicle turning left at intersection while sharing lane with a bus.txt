# Define the description for the scenario
description = 'vehicle turning left at intersection while sharing lane with a bus'

# 1. Get all objects of category 'VEHICLE'
# These are the primary candidates we are interested in.
all_vehicles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='VEHICLE')

# 2. Get all objects of category 'BUS'
# These will be used to check the "sharing lane with a bus" condition.
all_buses = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BUS')

# 3. Identify vehicles that are turning left.
# The 'turning' function filters 'all_vehicles' to those making a left turn.
vehicles_turning_left = turning(all_vehicles, log_dir, direction='left')

# 4. Identify vehicles that are on an intersection.
# The 'on_intersection' function filters 'all_vehicles' to those located on an intersection.
vehicles_on_intersection = on_intersection(all_vehicles, log_dir)

# 5. Combine the "turning left" and "on intersection" conditions for vehicles.
# We use 'scenario_and' to find vehicles that satisfy BOTH conditions simultaneously (i.e., at the same timestamps).
# The resulting 'vehicles_turning_left_at_intersection' dictionary will contain vehicles
# that are turning left while also being on an intersection.
vehicles_turning_left_at_intersection = scenario_and([vehicles_turning_left, vehicles_on_intersection])

# 6. Identify vehicles (from the set of those turning left at an intersection)
#    that are sharing a lane with a bus.
# The 'in_same_lane' function takes the filtered vehicles (track_candidates)
# and checks if they are in the same lane as any of the 'all_buses' (related_candidates).
# The result will be a dictionary of vehicles from 'vehicles_turning_left_at_intersection'
# that meet this additional "sharing lane with a bus" criteria.
vehicle_turning_left_at_intersection_sharing_lane_with_bus = in_same_lane(
    vehicles_turning_left_at_intersection,

# 7. Output the final scenario.
# This will save the instances of vehicles that meet all the specified conditions.
