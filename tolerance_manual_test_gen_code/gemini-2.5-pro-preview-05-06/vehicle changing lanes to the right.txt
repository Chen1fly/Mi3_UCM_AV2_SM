# description: vehicle changing lanes to the right

# Get all objects of category "VEHICLE"

# Identify vehicles that are changing lanes to the right
# The changing_lanes function directly supports specifying the direction of the lane change.
right_lane_changes = changing_lanes(vehicles, log_dir, direction='right')

# Output the scenario
# This will save the identified instances of vehicles changing lanes to the right.
