# based on the number and relative position of 'related_candidates' (pedestrians).
# - direction='left': Specifies the relative direction from the vehicle's perspective.
# - min_number=2: Ensures that there are at least two pedestrians ("multiple")
#   in that direction for the condition to be met.
# - within_distance (default 50m): Maximum distance for considering a pedestrian
#   in the specified direction.
# - lateral_thresh (default np.inf): Maximum lateral distance the pedestrian can be
#   from the sides of the vehicle (effectively, for 'left' direction, this constrains
#   how far forward or backward the "left" zone extends). Using the default np.inf
#   means a wide longitudinal range, consistent with a general "to the left" query
#   when not further specified (similar to example 'vehicles_with_peds_in_front').
