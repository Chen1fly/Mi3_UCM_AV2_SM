# The user wants to find scenarios with two of the same work truck.
# "Work truck" can be interpreted as the "TRUCK" or "BOX_TRUCK" categories.
# First, we get all objects belonging to the "TRUCK" category.
trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='TRUCK')

# Next, we get all objects belonging to the "BOX_TRUCK" category.
box_trucks = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='BOX_TRUCK')

# We can combine these two categories into a single 'work_trucks' scenario dictionary
# using scenario_or. This will give us all instances of either a TRUCK or a BOX_TRUCK.
work_trucks = scenario_or([trucks, box_trucks])

# To find two of the same work truck, we can look for work trucks that are near other work trucks.
# We can use the near_objects function for this. We'll use the 'work_trucks' dictionary
# for both the track_candidates and the related_candidates.
# We set min_objects=2 to ensure that we find a work truck only when there is at least one other work truck nearby (totaling two).
# We set include_self=False to prevent a truck from being counted as being near itself.
# A distance_thresh of 25 meters is a reasonable distance to consider the trucks as being in the same scene.
two_work_trucks = near_objects(work_trucks, work_trucks, log_dir, distance_thresh=25, min_objects=2, include_self=True)

# Finally, we output the resulting scenario.
output_scenario(two_work_trucks, description, log_dir, output_dir)
