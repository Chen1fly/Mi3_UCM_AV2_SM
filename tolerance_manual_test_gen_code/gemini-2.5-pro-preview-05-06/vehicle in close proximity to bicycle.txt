# Scenario: vehicle in close proximity to bicycle
# ------------------------------------------------
# This scenario flags any vehicle that comes within a very short distance
# (≤ 4 m) of at least one bicycle while both are on the road.  Requiring both
# object classes to be on‐road helps reduce false positives from parked cars or
# bikes left on sidewalks, and the tight distance threshold further focuses on
# genuinely close interactions likely relevant to autonomous‐driving behavior.
