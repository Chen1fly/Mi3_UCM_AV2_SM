# Then, find the buses that have at least 3 pedestrians within a 5-meter distance.
# 'buses' are the primary objects we are searching for.
# 'pedestrians' are the related objects we are checking for proximity to the buses.
# 'distance_thresh=5' sets the maximum distance for a pedestrian to be considered "near".
# 'min_objects=3' sets the minimum number of pedestrians that must be near a bus.

# Finally, output the identified scenarios with a clear description.
