# The user is asking to find instances of an "excavator"
# There is no "EXCAVATOR" category in the dataset.
# The closest category would be "TRUCK" which includes utility trucks, or "LARGE_VEHICLE".
# We will use the "TRUCK" category as a proxy for "excavator" since an excavator is a type of utility truck.
# This may result in false positives as it will include all trucks.
