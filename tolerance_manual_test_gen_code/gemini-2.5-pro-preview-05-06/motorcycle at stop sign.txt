# Description: motorcycle at stop sign
# First, get all objects categorized as 'MOTORCYCLE'.
motorcycles = get_objects_of_category(log_dir, category='MOTORCYCLE')

# Then, filter these motorcycles to find those that are at a stop sign.
# The at_stop_sign function identifies objects within a certain distance of a stop sign.
# By default, forward_thresh is 10m, which seems reasonable for this case.
motorcycles_at_stop_sign = at_stop_sign(motorcycles, log_dir)

# Output the scenario.
# This will create a file with the identified motorcycles at stop signs.
